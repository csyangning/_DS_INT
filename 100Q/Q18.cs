// 18. Minimal Number of Palindromes on a String
// Problem: A string can be partitioned into some substrings, such that each substring is a palindrome. 
//For example, there are a few strategies to split the string “abbab” into palindrome substrings, such as: “abba”|”b”, “a”|”b”|”bab” and “a”|”bb”|”a”|”b”.
// Given a string str, please get the minimal numbers of splits to partition it into palindromes. 
// The minimal number of splits to partition the string “abbab” into a set of palindromes is 1.
